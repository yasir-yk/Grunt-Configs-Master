What is this?
=====

It is a set of configuration files for your projects. Choose one option. Download and put it in the root of your project folder (not in the 'markup' folder, but next to 'input' folder).

Before you can use it
=====

First you need to install `w3m` npm package.

Open command line and type `npm -g install w3m`. You need to do this only once.

What next
=====

Open your project folder, press `Shift + RightClick` and run the command line. Than type `w3m`.

While the magic happens, you have time to have a tea.

Really, what happens?
=====

`w3m` script will download and configure project template, create correct folder structure, install grunt plugins, run Grunt and finally open your project in browser.
